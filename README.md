# Getting Started with this boilerplate including React and TailwindCSS 🔥

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and includes [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Folders

In the `src` folder, you can find the `assets`, `components` and `styles` folders.\
This one contains the files 'output.css' ( do not modify! ⛔) and the file 'tailwind.css' (which you can obviously modify! 😁).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
