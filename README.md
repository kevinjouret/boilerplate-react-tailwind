# Getting Started with this boilerplate including React, TailwindCSS and React Icons ✨

This project was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and includes [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)


## Installation 🔥

To install this boilerplate just type in your terminal :

```
npx degit https://github.com/kevinjouret/boilerplate-react-tailwind.git
```


## Folders 📁

In the `src` folder, you can find the `assets`, `components` and `styles` folders.\
This one contains the files `output.css` (don't modify ! ⛔) and the file `tailwind.css` (of course you can modify it ! 😁).


## Available Scripts 📜

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.


```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed !
